=========== Yaw Kessey-Ankomah ===========
Yaw's submission for this project I believe is worth that of Full Marks. 

The submission PDF correctly lists both the URL to the repository and its
respective GitHub Pages site URL. The structure of the HTML code is very organized 
and is split section by section using <divs> (with unique ids).

Yaw successfully included all 9 required sections listed in the requirements
for this milestone of the project. The only thing I would argue is missing are form
tags (however, this was not listed in the main requirements section)

=========== Michael Brian Lopez ===========
Michael's submission for this project I believe is worth that of Full Marks. 

Not only does the submission PDF correctlty list both the URL for the repository and the site, but
Michael also wrote a very detailed Work Description, even going as far as to write justifications
for certain things such as the placement of the menu section and problems that are faced with YouTube embedding.

The GitHub repository has a well organized folder structure, with all images used in its own directory.
The HTML code is clean and very well structured as well. Michael used section tags with unique class names (as well as enclosing most of the code in <main> tags)
Michael has fufilled every main requirement listed in instructions PDF. The only thing I notice missing are
<span> and <form> tags. However, I think in the grand scheme of things, these are minor. 

=========== Toni Ross Lagat Santiago ===========
Ross's submission for this project I believe is worth that of a 3 / Good.

The submission PDF document lists both the URL for the repository and the GH Pages site.

However, Ross is missing both the menu section and the projects section listed 
under the major requirements. Otherwise, I think the project is good overall

=========== Andrew C Henkel ===========
Andrew's submission for this prohect I believe is worth that of Full Marks

Andrew not only fufilled the requirementes listed in the instructional PDF 
but he did so with detail, especially with the submission PDF. 

The HTML code was also very well structured
